# Radish Project - Website Design Document

## Design Concept Overview

### Core Visual Metaphor
**"The Donkey Chasing the Green Radish"** - A charming pastoral cartoon representation where a small donkey is perpetually chasing a fresh green radish that's cleverly tied to its own head. This metaphor perfectly captures:
- The symbiotic relationship between Donkey coin and Radish token
- The self-sustaining nature of the ecosystem
- The playful, MEME-inspired community spirit
- The idea that pursuing one goal naturally benefits the other
- The fresh, natural growth of both communities
